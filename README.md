# Credit-Card-Customer-Segmentation
Credit Card Customer Segmentation Using K-means Clustering Model

# Problem Statement
The dataset provides credit card usage information for the last 6 months. The main objective is to analyze credit card usage patterns and understand customer shopping behavior.

# Objective
* Determine the average balance that customers maintain and identify groups of customers that maintain high balances.
* To identify customers who frequently make purchases using their credit cards and the amount shot for those purchases.
* To analyze credit limits granted to customers and identify customers who exceed their credit limits.

# Overall analysis 
In this case, K-Means analysis can be used to group consumers into groups based on their buying behavior. Thus, K-Means analysis can help understand market behavior and develop more effective marketing strategies.

Credit card user categories:
* Cluster 0 = above average
* Cluster 1 = medium
* Cluster 2 = below average

* Cluster 0 has a high average credit limit value, and the frequency of making purchase transactions is very low.
* Cluster 1 has a high average credit limit value, and the frequency of making purchase transactions is very high.
* Cluster 2 has the lowest average credit limit value, and the frequency of making purchase transactions is quite high.
